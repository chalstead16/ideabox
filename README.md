## <span style="color: #5356A4;">Overview</span>
IdeaBox! Everyone has ideas. Good ones, bad ones, etc.
\
Here we have created a space for the user to note their ideas while they are still fresh, preventing them from becoming forever lost in the unconscious mind.
\
Bad idea? Delete it forever. Good idea? add it to favorites! Whatever the idea may be, the user now has a space to further explore that brainchild!

*The best way to have a good idea is to have a lot of ideas.

## <span style="color: #5356A4;">Saving An Idea</span>
  - Once the Ideabox App loads, the user will find themselves at the main page.

  - From here the user will give their idea a title that vaguely describes their idea.
  - The body input field is where their brainchild will live. Once both the title, and input fields are filled out, the user may then, click the save button to display their idea.
  - The user will know they may save their idea if the mouse becomes a pointer when they hover over the save button.
  - If there are no values in the Title and Body input fields, the user will not be able to click save.
  - The user will know this is the case when they hover over the save button and see a lighter color, and the mouse is not a pointer.

## <span style="color: #5356A4;">Favoriting and Deleting Cards</span>
  - After idea cards have been added to the page there are icons on each card to star the idea or delete the idea.
  - Clicking on the star icon on the card will change the icon from white to red.
  - The icon will stay starred until it is clicked again.

  - The delete icon on the card will change from white to red when the cursor moves over it.
  - When the red delete icon is clicked it deletes the idea and removes it from the screen.

  - All the cards on the screen behave independently and clicking on any one card will not affect any other cards currently shown.
  - Additionally adding cards does not change any of the current cards that are already shown.
